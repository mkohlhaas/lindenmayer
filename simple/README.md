# Experimenting with Racket as a language workbench

This directory contains a simplified implementation of the lindenmayer

a feature to a Racket-based programming language.

See some [project
suggestions](https://plt.eecs.northwestern.edu/cocodo/) developed for
the [Raincode Labs Compiler Coding Dojo](https://cocodo.github.io).
